## Lancaster University Students üéì

As a Lancaster University student, you should use the pre-built VM hosted on the MyLab system that can be found [here](https://mylab.lancs.ac.uk). You may use it in the web browser or the VMWare Horizon client application, but expect a better user experience with the client application. You should use your university credentials to login to the VM and you will have access to your shared storage.

This pre-built VM contains all the software required to complete the tasks and some user-friendly applications such as VS Code, so you can use the VM as both a build and testing environment (as is recommended).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è All assessed work for SCC365 will be carried out on MyLab. If for any reason you do not complete any assessed work on the MyLab platform, test any work on MyLab prior to submission as you can not be marked on any non-MyLab VM.

## Software

The VM contains software that is typically incompatible with non-Linux systems, and is somewhat inconvenient to install even on Linux systems. This is why the VM is expected to be used for all SCC365 activities, including the tutorials.

Some of the software components installed in the VM are as follows:
 - Mininet
 - Wireshark
 - Open vSwitch

## Using the VM

To use the materials in this repository to build a local copy of the VM you must have the following components installed:

 - Git
 - Virtual Box
 - Vagrant

With these installed, clone this repository to your device then use vagrant to build and start the VM:

1. `git clone https://github.com/scc365/virtual-machine scc365vm`
2. `cd scc365vm`
3. `vargrant up`

To login to the VM, use the following credentials:
 - **Username**: `vagrant`
 - **Password**: `vagrant`
